# Yanda's Running Rust Notes

The note will cover my journey over [the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). In particular, I'll actively
compare Rust with C++ 17 and Python 3, maybe with a bit Java and JavaScript.
It's interesting to see how the language is designed and why it chose one route
against the other one.

!!! question "Why MkDocs?"

    My other options are Notion and Obisidian. But MkDocs is so much better with tabs, code annotation and such.

The note serves such a purpose: suppose I forget about Rust for half a year and
then coming back later, the note should be able to get me back to speed within
an hour.

!!! question "How do I use this note?"

    Here I'm assuming there really would be someone (other than myself) that read these notes.
    You shall go over the Rust book yourself, and come back for references.
    The notes is by no mean a "tutorial" style quick started guide.
